          Hi, I'm <span className="strong">William</span> and I'm a Full-Stack
          Web Developer specializing in PostgresQL, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js
          (PERN) stack. Since building my first gaming PC at the age of 12 in
          order to gain a competitive edge in Counter-Strike, I have been
          fascinated by the world of computers. I want to use web development as
          a platform to intermarry my background in Biochemistry and Economics
          with my passion for technology.

          When I am not on my computer, you can find me taking my dog on
          picturesque adventures while satiating my hunger for good food
          wherever I go. When Iâ€™m not outside, I can be found engaging in
          competitive gaming and fantasy sports (specifically, basketball and
          football). I believe in lifelong self-development, finding ways to
          maximize efficiency, and following my passion for technology and the
          latest electronic trends.
